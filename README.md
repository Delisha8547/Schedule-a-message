Scheduled Messaging Application
Project Overview

The Scheduled Messaging Application is a robust system that allows users to compose and schedule SMS messages to be automatically delivered at a specified date and time. The application is designed to simplify delayed communication by automating message delivery while ensuring reliability and accuracy.

By integrating the Twilio API, the system handles real-time SMS dispatching and provides dependable message delivery, making it suitable for reminders, alerts, and time-sensitive notifications.
